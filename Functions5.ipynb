        "1. What is NumPy, and why is it widely used in Python?\n",
        "Answer- NumPy (Numerical Python) is a powerful library used for numerical computing in Python. It provides support for large multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays efficiently. NumPy is widely used due to its speed, ability to handle large datasets, and built-in functions for mathematical and statistical operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. How does broadcasting work in NumPy?\n",
        "Answer- Broadcasting in NumPy allows operations on arrays of different shapes without explicitly reshaping them. When performing element-wise operations, NumPy automatically expands smaller arrays to match the shape of larger ones, following specific broadcasting rules. This makes computations more efficient and avoids unnecessary memory allocation.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is a Pandas DataFrame?\n",
        "Answer- A Pandas DataFrame is a two-dimensional, labeled data structure similar to a table or spreadsheet. It consists of rows and columns, where each column can hold different data types. It provides powerful data manipulation, filtering, and analysis capabilities.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Explain the use of the groupby() method in Pandas.\n",
        "Answer- The groupby() method in Pandas is used to group data based on one or more columns. It enables operations like aggregation (e.g., sum, mean), transformation, and filtering on grouped data, making it useful for analyzing categorical data efficiently.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Why is Seaborn preferred for statistical visualizations?\n",
        "Answer- Seaborn is preferred for statistical visualizations because it provides a high-level interface for creating aesthetically pleasing and informative graphs.

        "\n",
        "13. Why is handling missing data important in Pandas?\n",
        "Answer- Handling missing data is crucial because missing values can lead to incorrect analysis and errors in calculations. Pandas provides functions like dropna(), fillna(), and interpolate() to handle missing values efficiently.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. What are the benefits of using Plotly for data visualization?\n",
